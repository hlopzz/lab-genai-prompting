    "**Objective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn and apply different prompting techniques to improve the performance of a language model in generating customer support responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Case:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are working for a company that provides a variety of services, including technical support, billing inquiries, and general customer service. Your task is to use a language model to automate responses to customer emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the FAQ of a company to do this exercise. Below you have a couple of examples, but feel free to find your own:\n",
    " - https://info.undp.org/erecruit/documents/FAQ.pdf\n",
    " - https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/Images/696254-faqs-digital-cambridge-english-qualifications.pdf\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Download and Read the PDF:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Choose one of the provided FAQ PDFs or find your own relevant FAQ document.\n",
    "  - Read through the FAQ document carefully to understand the types of questions and answers it contains.\n",
    "  - Create Questions Based on the PDF ( you can use ChatGPT for this)\n",
    "    - Generate a list of potential customer questions that could be answered using the information from the FAQ PDF.\n",
    "    - Ensure your questions cover a variety of topics and difficulty levels found within the document.\n",
    "    - Generate Responses Using Different Prompting Techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a language model (such as ChatGPT) to generate responses to your questions.\n",
    "Experiment with different prompting techniques to see how they affect the quality of the responses."
